DONE:
- Changed child contract type to Child at creation
- Fix getAmountIn()
- swap all collaterals for bases (where it makes sense)
- Fix all pricing -- needs to be in terms of USDC, not USD (similar to how we did it for UNI)
- Make a "getPriceInUSDC()" funciton 
- Make withdrawing optional at sell event (2/2 complete)
- Update accounting State before sending gains to user
- Consider putting getAmountIn(), and "closeOutCalculations()" in the same library or a library of their own
- Test whether we can work with updated variables in state after we update them
    -> It is sychronous, which is good
- If a subfunction is adminOnly, can a parent function call it if the sender is admin?
- If there is outstanding debt:
    - Built function that let's frontend know whether or not there is any outstanding debt
    - Update hasDebt = true when opening (or reopening position)
    - Update hasDebt = false when no more debt exists (debtToken)
    - Update openPositions array when opening or (reopening a position)
    - Update openPositions array when all base tokens have been exhausted
- Ensured we're grabbing debt token correctly with newly found struct object information
- Now returning a list of structs for aggregated contract data
- Remove reentrancy guard for erc20 transfer
- With newfound divider function, ensure all calculations work with a returned WEI
- KEY WORDS TO DELETE: Remix, gonna work
- Ensure all functions that can be made "view" are made "view" (All "give me data" functions)
- If there is outstanding debt:
    - If the user decides to pay the outstanding debt in the base token, we need a function that will return exactly how much to pay
        -> We already have this... It's the library! 
              - Option 1: Frontend talks directly to a deployed external library
              - Option 2: We have a (temporary) funciton that the frontend can hit, which returns that data from the internal library [Let's do this for now, until we figure out how to make library external]
- We need a function that returns user account data


TODO:
- Document that collater = base -- Consider whether to call it that or collateral token every where
- After MVP, could make an external library for other devs to use
- Consider allowing shAave previledge to see all user data
- Since we made collateral withdraw optional, we now need an additional function that allows users to withdraw the max amount (or up to the max amount) of collateral
- When calling the short() function, we need to do token validation via Aave's getReservesList() and Uniswap's getPool()
